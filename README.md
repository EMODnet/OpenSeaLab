# OpenSeaLab
EMODnet - your gateway to marine data in Europe - holds a wealth of marine data. There are 8 thematic portals in a consortium made up of more than 160 organisations assembling marine data, products and metadata to make these fragmented resources more available to public and private users relying on quality-assured, standardised and harmonised marine data which are interoperable and essentially free of restrictions on use. 

We understand that it may be a bit overwhelming to find your way around the data from EMODnet, so we tried to make it easier for you by listing the web services and providing some datasets for you to use during the Open Sea lab. Get inspired by exploring the data made available here. If there is a particular theme or dataset that you'd like to see listed here, don't hesitate to send us an email and we'll get back to you straight away.
